This is an attempt to turn The PicoLisp Wiki into on interactive PicoLisp
Notebook (with an emphasis on writing music, as that is where my interest
lies.) It uses the built-in 'repl' (from '@lib/form.l') and so the server can
be completely controlled from the browser. Use caution, run locally, etc.

The original README follows:

         The PicoLisp Wiki
         =================

To explore the PicoLisp Wiki, install an up-to-date PicoLisp system (as an OS
distribution package, or from http://software-lab.de/down.html), and unpack the
tarball "wiki.tgz" (http://software-lab.de/wiki.tgz) in some convenient place.

"wiki.tgz" will go into a "wiki/" subdirectory.

Then run it as

   $ pil wiki/main.l -main -go +

This will start the server, and create another subdirectory, "db/wiki/",
containing a minimal database setup.


The server listens at port 5000, so you can point your browser to

   http://localhost:5000

or, if you have 'httpGate' running, to

   http://localhost/5000

In both cases, you'll see the wiki application GUI (officially at
http://wiki.picolisp.com). Log in as user "admin" and password "admin".

On the console, the PicoLisp prompt ':' appears.


The initial database contains two roles ("Administrator" and "Member"), a single
user ("admin"), and three documents ("help", "menu" and "home").

A click on the "Wiki" link on the top left switches to the wiki website view
(officially at http://home.picolisp.com), and from there "My account" will bring
you back into the application GUI.

As ever, the debug session (the server's child process handling the current GUI
session) can be terminated with Ctrl-D. If this is followed by Ctrl-C, the
server (parent) process will terminate too.
